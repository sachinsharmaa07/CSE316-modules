"C-based simulator comparing FIFO, LRU, Optimal page replacement algorithms with text visualizations and fault metrics for OS memory management education."
Project Report: Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator
The Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator is designed to demonstrate and compare the efficiency of three key memory management algorithms—FIFO (First-In-First-Out), LRU (Least Recently Used), and Optimal—in a virtual memory system. The primary goal is to provide an educational tool that allows users to input page reference strings and frame counts, visualize how pages are managed in memory, and analyze performance metrics like page faults and hit ratios. Expected outcomes include a clear understanding of algorithm behavior, their strengths and weaknesses, and a practical comparison of their efficiency in handling page replacement scenarios. The scope encompasses a user-friendly interface, core simulation logic, and visual representation of results, targeting students, educators, and developers interested in operating systems concepts. The project supports a predefined set of inputs (up to 100 pages and 10 frames) and focuses on text-based or graphical output, depending on the implementation. It aims to be modular, extensible (e.g., adding new algorithms), and portable across platforms. By simulating real-world memory management, it bridges theoretical knowledge with practical application, offering insights into how different strategies impact system performance. The simulator is not intended for real-time OS integration but serves as a standalone learning tool. Deliverables include a functional program with detailed output, a summary of results, and documentation for future enhancements, ensuring it meets educational objectives while remaining simple enough for classroom demonstrations.
