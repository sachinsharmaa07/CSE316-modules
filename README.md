"C-based simulator comparing FIFO, LRU, Optimal page replacement algorithms with text visualizations and fault metrics for OS memory management education."
Project Report: 
Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator
The Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator is designed to demonstrate and compare the efficiency of three key memory management algorithms—FIFO (First-In-First-Out), LRU (Least Recently Used), and Optimal—in a virtual memory system. The primary goal is to provide an educational tool that allows users to input page reference strings and frame counts, visualize how pages are managed in memory, and analyze performance metrics like page faults and hit ratios. Expected outcomes include a clear understanding of algorithm behavior, their strengths and weaknesses, and a practical comparison of their efficiency in handling page replacement scenarios. The scope encompasses a user-friendly interface, core simulation logic, and visual representation of results, targeting students, educators, and developers interested in operating systems concepts. The project supports a predefined set of inputs (up to 100 pages and 10 frames) and focuses on text-based or graphical output, depending on the implementation. It aims to be modular, extensible (e.g., adding new algorithms), and portable across platforms. By simulating real-world memory management, it bridges theoretical knowledge with practical application, offering insights into how different strategies impact system performance. The simulator is not intended for real-time OS integration but serves as a standalone learning tool. Deliverables include a functional program with detailed output, a summary of results, and documentation for future enhancements, ensuring it meets educational objectives while remaining simple enough for classroom demonstrations.
Module-Wise Breakdown (150 words each)
GUI (Graphical User Interface) Module
Purpose: The GUI module serves as the user-facing component, enabling interaction with the simulator. It collects inputs (page references, frame count) and displays results in an accessible format.

Role: It acts as the entry point, ensuring ease of use and clear communication of simulation outcomes. It validates inputs to prevent errors and triggers the simulation process, passing data to the logic module and presenting visualized results from the data visualization module. In the HTML version, it includes input fields and buttons styled with CSS, dynamically updating the output div with tables and summaries. For a C version, it could use console prompts or a graphical library like SDL. Its role is critical for user engagement, making complex algorithms approachable through intuitive controls and feedback.

ML (Memory Logic) Module
Purpose: The Memory Logic (ML) module handles the core simulation of page replacement algorithms—FIFO, LRU, and Optimal.
Role: It processes the page reference string and frame count to simulate memory management, tracking frame states and calculating page faults. In the HTML version, JavaScript functions like simulate_fifo implement the logic, while in C, it’s encapsulated in functions like run_simulation. It maintains algorithm-specific rules (e.g., FIFO shifts pages, LRU tracks usage, Optimal predicts future use) and provides data (faults, frame states) to other modules. This module ensures accuracy and efficiency, forming the computational backbone of the simulator, independent of how results are displayed, allowing reuse across different interfaces.

Data Visualization Module
Purpose: The Data Visualization module presents simulation results in a comprehensible, visual format to aid understanding.

Role: It transforms raw data (frame states, faults) into tables, charts, or graphical displays. In the HTML version, it generates an HTML table with fault-highlighted rows and a summary of faults and hit ratios. In a C version, it could print text tables or use SDL for graphical rendering. Its role is to highlight differences between algorithms visually, making it easier to compare their performance (e.g., fewer faults in Optimal). It relies on the ML module for data and works with the GUI to ensure the output is user-friendly, enhancing the educational value by showing step-by-step changes in memory.
